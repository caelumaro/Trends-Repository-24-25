Hello!ðŸ‘‹
This is a sample rÃ©sumÃ© website I created as a requirement for my **CSDC105 - Trends in Application Development** course.
The website is responsive to different screen sizes; however, it is not fully optimized yet, and I plan to improve it soon.
For now, I am focusing on meeting the specifications required by our teacher.
The overall layout is inspired by Bryl Limâ€”credit goes to him.
